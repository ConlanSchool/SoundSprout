# Sound Sprout - (In Development)

This repository consists of a full stack application that uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for the frontend, and Python [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) with [Django Rest Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) for the backend API, all backed by a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database.

## The project is organized into two main subfolders:

- `/frontend`: This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with create-next-app using TypeScript & TailWindCSS
- `/backend`: This is a Django project, equipped with Django Rest Framework for creating API endpoints.
